## Introduction
This project aims to implement and fine-tune a transformer-based model for generating trade recommendations. By leveraging advanced machine learning techniques and financial data, the model provides Buy, Sell, and Hold signals to inform trading decisions.

Installation
To set up the environment and install necessary libraries, follow these steps:

bash
Copy code

    #Install essential build tools
    apt-get install -y build-essential cmake libffi-dev python3-dev
      
    #Download and install TA-Lib
     wget http://prdownloads.sourceforge.net/ta-lib/ta-lib-0.4.0-src.tar.gz
     tar -xf ta-lib-0.4.0-src.tar.gz
     cd ta-lib
     ./configure --prefix=/usr
     make
     make install
    
    #Install TA-Lib Python wrapper
     pip install TA-Lib
    
    #Install other required Python libraries
     pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn torch gym
    
## Data Preprocessing
### Loading and Adjusting Data
* Load the dataset from a CSV file.
* Normalize price columns for consistency.
    * Compute technical indicators using TA-Lib:
    * Momentum Indicators: RSI, MACD, Stochastic Oscillator.
    * Volume Indicators: OBV.
    * Volatility Indicators: Bollinger Bands, ATR.
    * Trend Indicators: ADX, DI, CCI.
    * Other Indicators: DLR, TWAP, VWAP.
* Handle missing values by dropping rows with NaN values.
  
### Feature Scaling
* Standardize the features using StandardScaler from sklearn.
* Define the target variable based on the next day's price movement.
* Create a custom PyTorch Dataset class to structure data into sequences of 60 time steps.
  
### Model Creation
#### LSTM Model Architecture
* Define an LSTM model with:
  * LSTM layer for capturing temporal dependencies.
  * Fully connected layer for classification.
* Use Cross-Entropy Loss for the loss function.
* Use Adam optimizer for training the model.

### Training the Model
Train the model over multiple epochs.
Monitor and log training loss to track convergence.

### Evaluation and Recommendations
* Evaluate the trained model on the test dataset to assess accuracy.
* Generate trade recommendations (Buy, Sell, Hold) and save them in a CSV file.
  
### Reinforcement Learning-Based Trading Strategy
#### Trading Environment
* Develop a custom trading environment using OpenAI's Gym framework.
* Define the state representation and action space.
* Implement a simple policy gradient-based agent:
      * Neural network policy for action selection.
      * Training loop to maximize cumulative profit through reinforcement learning.
  
### Conclusion
The transformer-based model effectively utilizes machine learning techniques for generating trade recommendations. By integrating technical analysis, LSTM modeling, and reinforcement learning, the project provides a robust framework for making data-driven trading decisions.
